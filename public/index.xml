      <description>You can find more about what I do at the following places:
Timlah.com, which includes information about all of my projects GitHub, which is where all of my public code lives Here, think of this as a landing point Mastodon, @Timlah, which is where my thinking out loud happens In future I plan to add resources for my future game development studio.
In the past I ran a social group GeekOut South-West and oversaw the progress of its only sister site, GeekOut West-Midlands.</description>

      <description>I decided to write this website in as quick a time as possible. I wanted to make something minimalist that I could use to point readers to different places on the web where I reside.
To make this website, I used Hugo. If you have a need for a simple website quick at a reasonable price, reach out to me by email or Mastodon and talk to me about your needs.</description>
