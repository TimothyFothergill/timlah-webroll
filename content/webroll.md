You can find more about what I do at the following places:
- [Timlah.com](https://www.timlah.com/), which includes information about all of my projects
- [GitHub](https://www.github.com/TimothyFothergill), which is where all of my public code lives
- Here, think of this as a landing point
- [Mastodon, @Timlah](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@Timlah), which is where my thinking out loud happens

In future I plan to add resources for my future game development studio.

In the past I ran a social group GeekOut South-West and oversaw the progress of its only sister site, GeekOut West-Midlands.
